# OptimizedNestedMapping

## Project Overview

**OptimizedNestedMapping** is a Solidity smart contract designed to demonstrate the use of nested mappings while focusing on gas optimization and security. The contract allows users to store, retrieve, and clear values associated with their Ethereum address in a nested mapping structure. The key features include:

- **Nested Mapping**: Each address is mapped to a mapping of keys to values, allowing for efficient data storage.
- **Gas Optimization**: The contract is optimized to minimize gas fees, especially during operations like clearing values.
- **Security**: The contract follows Solidity best practices to ensure safety and integrity.
